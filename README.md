# 102lab6

In lab 6 we are to: 
Add at least 3 dynamic components to your web page. These can be based on user input, or other dynamic input data.

<img src="2714.svg" width="10px"/>  At least one dynamic component should be based on user input.

<img src="274C.svg" width="10px"/>  At least one dynamic component should use a conditional statement to determine the output.

<img src="274C.svg" width="10px"/>  Stretch Goal: Try out the confirm() function, in addition to prompt(). Whenâ€™s the right time to use this?

<img src="274C.svg" width="10px"/>  Stretch Goal: If the user gives you a color, can you set a part of your page to be that color?

I fell short on Draft one of lab 6 but will try to improve it.
